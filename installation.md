**How to install Sharp Look**

Sharp Look can be downloaded from our download page, and since you access this page, you can also check the change log to get in touch with all the new and improved features of this module.
<br />
<br />
In order to install Sharp Look on your DNN website you have to follow the same steps with which you got familiar until now, and which are listed bellow - just to be sure nothing is skipped:
<br />
* Log into your DNN site as Administrator;

* Select Extensions option from Host menu;

* Click on the Install Extension Wizard button;

* On the Upload New Extension Package page, click on Choose File button;

* Select the Sharp Look package you previously downloaded on your hard drive, then click on Open;

* Click on Next and follow the installation wizard.
<br />
<br />
That's all you have to know about installing the module. Keep in mind that we're dealing with a customization module and if you want to make sure the installation was successful, check whether the module was saved on the Skins section of the Host/Extensions page.  
<br />
