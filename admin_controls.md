All the DNN users are familiar with the Iconbar Mode which is found on all the pages and which has the purpose of providing a single interface from which authorized users can access pages and module management tools, shortcuts to the common administration tasks and quick links to the Admin and Host consoles. 

The options from the DNN Iconbar Mode drop down list are also available on Sharp Look. Besides the View, Edit, Layout options, Sharp Look comes with a fourth option, a Design option which if very useful in terms of customizing the design of the pages and with two other useful buttons like the cogwheel button which will open the Control Panel page and the Pin button which will change the arrangement of the Admin Controls to the right. All in all, Sharp Look comes in handy, you can create panes and layouts directly from the interface, you don't have to go on disk to build the skin files and mess with the data.
